## Misson 01

- I choose to React framework as it is a simple and best use for Single page application
- In this mission I used Airbnb React date range picker library for implementing date functionalities
- Then I make JSON file with dummy data as the data source of this application
- The next step was taking date range from the user and store them in react state 
- When the user clicks on the search button it will filter the emails based on the in-between dates
- The next step was showing results email in accordion.
- Throughout the application, I used CSS flexbox to designing layouts. For the mobile version of the application, the layout is changing lots of things
for this, I planned to use different layout instead of some complex media queries options
- I used the react-responsive library to use dynamic Media Query option in javascript
- Finally, I implemented the pagination

## Mission 02

- At first, I used to React Accordion to inspect the email body but this is designed for a single item to expand at a time. Then I came up with panel expansion methods
for flexible multi expandable items
- For implementing multi expandable items I stored state of every single element to decide whether it is currently open or not
