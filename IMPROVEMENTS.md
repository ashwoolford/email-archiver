## Here some improvements

## 1. Pagination: 
- Pagination is a robust way to improve UX and performance of the application
- I will limit the items per page  by some threshold value

## 2. Partially showing email body with the subject: 
- I think It is the best idea to show the email body as per it fit the display. Hence the user can easily find out which mail to check or not
- I will show each body along with the subject by a separator

## 3. Sorting emails
- Sorting emails by date would give the best user experience to the user
- In the date header, I will implement clickable icons such as up arrow and down arrow icons for sorting emails

## 4. Email search
- Searching emails by keywords is must needed options for the users. Sometimes the user needs to search a specific or group of emails by the keywords
- There would be another input field along with date field for giving desirable keywords

## 5. Collapsible emails
- Single-page applications are intended to provide the best experience to the users based on this idea user don't need to navigate to another page
for viewing the whole email
- I implemented this to the final version of the UI mockup. I put an option where the user can expand or collapse search result items. then the user would see 
the individual email then again user can expand them to the full view of the details email 

## 6. Read unread
- In other words, is that mail is opened or not and it is a fundamental option for an email archiver system
- We can bold all the texts from search result by default and then when the user would click the email, the particular email would mark as opened

## 8. multiple selections
- Using multiple selection user can do some sort of things such as marking as read or not or deleting emails
- There would be a button at the beginning of each row
